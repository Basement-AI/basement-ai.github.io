title = "ELOQUENT 2024 â€” Robustness Task",
abstract = "ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks for evaluating the quality and usefulness of generative language models. ELOQUENT aims to apply high-level quality criteria, grounded in experiences from deploying models in real-life tasks, and to formulate tests for those criteria, preferably implemented to require minimal human assessment effort and in a multilingual setting. One of the tasks for the first year of ELOQUENT was the robustness task, in which we assessed the robustness and consistency of a model output given variation in the input prompts. We found that indeed the consistency varied, both across prompt items and across models, and on a methodological note we find that using a oracle model for assessing the submitted responses is feasible, and intend to investigate consistency across such assessments for different oracle models. We intend to run this task in coming editions for ELOQUENT to establish a solid methodology for further assessing consistency, which we believe to be a crucial component of trustworthiness as a top level quality characteristic of generative language models.",
